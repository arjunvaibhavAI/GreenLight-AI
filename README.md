# GreenLight AI | ESG Compliance Auditor
An AI-enabled solution designed to streamline the preliminary stages of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) compliance review for enterprise organizations.

## Business Problem
ESG compliance has become a critical requirement for modern enterprises. However:
- Reviewing long sustainability reports manually consumes significant time and consulting resources
- Businesses struggle with high cost and low speed during initial compliance checks
- Manual review creates delays in reporting cycles and slows down decision-making for leadership and regulatory teams

## Solution Approach
To address this challenge, I built GreenLight AI â€” an AI-powered auditor that:
- Allows users to upload ESG or sustainability reports
- Automatically scans and maps content against ESG compliance criteria
- Generates an initial compliance summary, highlighting which areas are covered and which require further attention

This solution demonstrates how AI can support high-value corporate governance workflows by reducing manual effort, speeding up compliance preparation, and enabling consultants or internal teams to focus on deeper strategic analysis rather than repetitive initial screening.

## Technology Used
- Python, LangChain & LangGraph
- Streamlit (User Interface)
- Local LLM via Ollama (for enterprise-friendly deployment)
- FAISS Vector Store (for document intelligence and retrieval)
